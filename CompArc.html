			<p> This course provides the student with an in-depth study of the organization of the central
				processing unit, arithmetic logic unit, control unit, instruction formats, and addressing
				schemes of digital computers</p>
			<p> Extensive emphasis is placed on the translation of assembly
				language instructions into their micro-sequence operations within the control unit and the
				interconnection and control of registers, arithmetic logic units, memory units, and busses
				which form the central processing unit and the digital computer</p>

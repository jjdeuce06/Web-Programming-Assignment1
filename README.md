# Web-Programming-Assignment1
## Overview
This program was the class's introduction to HTML and CSS. The purpose of this project was to create 2 html files that contained a mini biography about ourselves. One had no CSS, the other did. Within this file were links to other files that we created about our course schedule for the Fall 2024 semester. The link will take the user to a page with an image relating to the course and a basic description of the course. 

## Plain Site
Very simple implementation. Added an image of myself, a little bit about me, and links to the class files

## CSS site
This site had a bit more design to it. I changed the background color, font type, and font color of headers. This site functions the same as the plain site and has the same elements.

## Algorithm
Contains a description of my Analysis of Algorithms class and an image that relates to it

## COBOL
Contains a description of my COBOL class and an image that relates to it
